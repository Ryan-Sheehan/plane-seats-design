#### Seat Size

For our purposes, the design of existing economy seats will do with a couple of slight tweaks to their dimensions to increase their range of accomodation. 

The U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) contain requirements for "Minimum Space for Seated Passengers":
- Seat pitch: 29 in
- Distance between a seat and the object in front of it: 7 in
